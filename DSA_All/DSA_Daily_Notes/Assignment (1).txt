Assignment 1

1. Write a Java program to find the index of an array element.
2. You will be given an array and you need to find the third largest 

3. You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.

o/p -3

4. Rearrange Everything
Given an array of size n where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1, change contents of arr[] so that arr[i] = j is changed to arr[j] = i.

Q.1 Implement singly Circular Linked List

Q.2 Implement Doubly Linked List

3. How do you find the length of a singly linked list?
4. How are duplicate nodes removed in an unsorted linked list?
5. How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?
6. Java Program To Merge A Linked List Into Another Linked List At Alternate Positions.
7. How do you check if a given linked list contains a cycle? How do you find the starting node of the cycle?
8. Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
9. How to check if a given linked list is a palindrome?
10. You are given N numbers and a integer K. Your task is to reverse all the numbers before and after K.

11.a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted in ascending order.

Eg.
i/p
 20, 5, 10, 30, 25

o/p
 5,10, 20, 25, 30
				   		       th 
12. Consider a singly linked list. Rotate the list from k   position from the last node.
Eg.
  k = 2
10, 20, 30, 40, 50

After rotation
o/p
40, 50, 10, 20, 30

13. Create a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted 
as per given order - 20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
for insertion call various functions of insertion then delet elements from list by calling 
delAtBeg(), atPos(3), delAtLast() also display list after every deletion and after all insertion
i/p - 20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
o/p -20 40, 5, 3, 60, 50
after del-
o/p- 40, 3, 60

14. Write a program to reverse nodes of SLL
15. Create a singly linked list of integers such that all elements are inserted in ascending order.

Eg.
i/p
 20, 5, 10, 30, 25

o/p
 5,10, 20, 25, 30

A basic queue has the following operations:

Enqueue: add a new element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.

Your first task is to implement a queue. 
Then process  queries, where each query can be of three following types:


1 x:  Enqueue element  into the end of the queue.
2  :  Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3  :  Print the element at the front of the queue.

Assignment 9
Assign. Develop the following hashing functions:
	i) Using division method
	   Hint: Use largest prime number smaller than the array size
	ii) Using Radix to the base 11
	iii) Using Multiplication method
		Use constant c = 0.496235
	Consider the size of array in each case as 100
	
	Write the demo code to test each hashing method.
